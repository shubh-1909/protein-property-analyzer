# 🧬 Protein Property Analyzer using BioPython

This project analyzes protein sequences using Python and BioPython, calculating:

- ✅ Molecular weight
- ✅ Isoelectric point (pI)
- ✅ Hydrophobicity (GRAVY score)
- ✅ Amino acid composition
- ✅ Bar chart visualization of amino acid distribution

## 📌 How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the `.py` or `.ipynb` file
2. Run using:
   - Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for `.ipynb`
   - VS Code or any Python IDE for `.py`
3. Paste any valid protein sequence and view analysis results
